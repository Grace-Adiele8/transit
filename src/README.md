##Approach
I took into consideration coercion and separation of concerns while architecting my project folder. I created common components which I used as basic building blocks for my application. I used CSS to make my stylesheet more structured and maintainable. 

##Difficulties
The design had a lot of components for a single-page application which took a lot more of my time. The design also had a lot of inconsistencies which made it harder to implement the design
